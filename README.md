To get this website running locally, type this into your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wirtzdan/website danielwirtz.com
$ cd danielwirtz.com
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Make sure to add environmental variables, if you want to play around with the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg) and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) integration. To do so create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/wirtzdan/website/blob/master/.env.example).
